This is called the **Sierpinski Triangle** and it's a well known example of a **fractal**. A fractal is a pattern where similar patterns appear at all smaller scales as you zoom in.

What this means is that you will find an infinite number of copies of the Sierpinski Triangle nestled inside itself.
