It's very tempting to just take the average of 
9 and 7 to get 8. But when you ask this question, you're more likely to end up with 
9 suspects left than 7. To take this into account, your average should weigh 9 more heavily, so the average is actually more than 8.

This concept is called the “weighted average” or “expectation value.” You multiply each outcome by its probability and sum them up. In this case, we get
$\frac 9{16} × 9 + \frac 7{16} × 7 = 8.125$
As expected, this value is slightly higher than 8.
