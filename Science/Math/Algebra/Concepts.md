The practice of trying to generalize the lessons you learn is the core of mathematics. Math is all about understanding why patterns arise.

### Generalize
Always be looking for patterns and thinking of ways to use them. Depending on the problem, a pattern can turn an hour of aimless arithmetic into a single “aha!” moment.

### Rewrite, Redraw, Rethink
You'll see this elephant show up again and again, reminding you that it's important to **Rewrite, Redraw, and Rethink** the mathematics that you see, because there's always more than one way to see it.

### Math patterns
- Adding the first $n$ odd numbers will get you $n^2$
- Adding the 1$^{st}$ $n$ numbers: $\sum_{x=0{}}^{n}x=\frac{n\left(n+1\right)}{2}$

The fact you first choose to assume drastically affects how difficult it is to solve the rest of the problem.

## Elimination
### What you learn depends on what you know
If you can make any eliminations based on the facts provided, read the facts again to see if your new knowledge lets you see the facts in a new light and make more eliminations.

## Constraints
### Over-constrained
When a problem is unsolvable because it has constraints that cannot all be met at the same time, we call it over-constrained.

### Under-constrained
When there isn't enough information to answer the question a puzzle poses, we call it under-constrained.

## Numbers
### Products of divisors are divisors
When a number divides another number, then all the numbers that divide the smaller number also divide the larger number.

Example:
>If an unknown number is divisible by 24, it might be better to break down that 24 into its divisors and reason that, since $24=3×8$, the unknown number will obey both the divisibility rule for 3 and the rule for 8.
>You can think about that combination as being the divisibility rule for 24.


For example a number is divisible by 6 if it's divisible by 2 and 3.
A number is divisible by 4 if it's last two digits form a number which is divisible by 4.

### Comparing Pairs
A set of numbers can always be ordered by transforming the set into a series of pair comparisons.

### Make math mean something to you
The power of thinking with a real world analogy is that it makes math easier to understand.

### Bayesian Reasoning
When you are reasoning about what's true, it's tempting to say something is 100% certain or impossible. Resist this urge and get acquainted with uncertainty. Evidence helps us narrow down the space of possibilities to update probabilities as we learn more.

### Exponential growth
Whenever something is growing by a fixed percentage each time period, we have a type of explosive growth called an exponential.

A hallmark of exponential growth is that there is a fixed “doubling period”; after each doubling period the numbers double.

### Convert multi-digit numbers into algebra
Convert the digits of a number into algebraic expressions based on their place value.

### Symmetric nests
Choose any pair of numbers $x$ and $y$ on a number line. If you add a number to one $y$ and subtract that same number from $x$, you're moving symmetrically. The sum of every pair of numbers in these symmetric nests will be equal to the same value $x+y$.

### Isolate Small Pieces from the Whole
Look for opportunities to isolate one unknown value away from the rest using what you know about all of the values together.

### Breaking Up Numbers
By working backwards from a nice calculation, we can get an idea of when we can do something similar.

# Glossary
- A **prime number** is an integer greater than 1 whose only positive factors are 1 and itself. For example, 2,7, and 13 are all prime.

- **Factors** are numbers that we multiply together to get a product. For example, the factors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6 because $1×6=6$ and $2×3=6$.

- **algebraic Identity** - An algebraic identity is an equality that remains true regardless of the values chosen for the variables. For example, $x+y=y+x$ is true no matter what values are given to $x$ and $y$.

- The **Distributive Property** allows us to multiply any quantity by a sum by multiplying the quantity by each addend. For example, $a(b+c)=ab+ac$ and .

- A **perfect square** is a number that has a square root that is an integer. For example, 9 is a perfect square, so is 49.

- A **difference of squares** is one squared quantity subtracted from another squared quantity, such as $x^2 - 9$. Also, $a^2-b^2 = (a-b)(a+b)$.
