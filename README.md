Notes pertaining to the tools and technologies I use regularly. These notes primarily serve as a reference for myself, documenting operations I have previously executed. For instance, they include details on the arguments required for specific functions in various libraries or the appropriate flags to use with certain CLI tools.

My effort to organize the directories logically is ongoing, so some notes may be misfiled.
