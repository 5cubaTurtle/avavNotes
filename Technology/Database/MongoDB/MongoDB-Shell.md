The MongoDB Shell, `mongosh`, is a JavaScript and Node.js REPL environment for interacting with MongoDB deployments in [Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/), locally, or on another remote host. Use the MongoDB Shell to test queries and interact with the data in your MongoDB database.

Connect to a [`mongod`](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/program/mongod/#mongodb-binary-bin.mongod) that is running on your localhost with default port 27017: `mongosh`

For more information on connecting using [`mongosh`](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/mongodb-shell/#mongodb-binary-bin.mongosh), such as to connect to a [`mongod`](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/program/mongod/#mongodb-binary-bin.mongod) instance running on a different host and/or port, see the [mongosh documentation.](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/mongodb-shell/)

To help you start using MongoDB, MongoDB provides [Getting Started Guides](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/getting-started/#std-label-getting-started) in various driver editions. For the driver documentation, see [Start Developing with MongoDB.](https://api.mongodb.com/)
