> The **reference** is a term that where we want our system to be. A reference could be the target speed of a motor, the target angle that a drivetrain is facing, or any other state that we would like to control. This reference is the value that our closed-loop system is trying to converge our system's state on.
> **TLDR:** The reference is what the controller tries to converge on.

A common closed-loop implementation is a [[PID]] controller.
