While you can use [[apt-get]] to install ROS and its core components, it is not specifically designed for managing ROS packages.

ROS uses its own package management system called `rosdep`. `rosdep` is responsible for managing dependencies and resolving package dependencies within the ROS ecosystem. It allows you to install and manage ROS packages, including both core packages and community-contributed packages.

Here are the basic steps to use `rosdep` for managing ROS packages:

1. Initialize rosdep: Before using `rosdep`, you need to initialize it by running the following command:
   ```
   sudo rosdep init
   rosdep update
   ```

2. Install dependencies: If you have a package with dependencies that need to be installed, you can use `rosdep` to automatically install them. Run the following command in the root of your workspace where the package resides:
   ```
   rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
   ```

   This command will analyze the package dependencies and install any missing dependencies.

3. Build your workspace: After the dependencies are installed, you can proceed to build your workspace using the ROS build tool, `catkin` or `colcon`, depending on the ROS version you are using.

4. Install additional packages: If you want to install additional ROS packages not present in your workspace, you can use [[apt-get]] or other package managers specific to your Linux distribution. These additional packages may include ROS libraries, tools, or specific robot-related packages.

It's important to note that [[apt-get]] is used for system-level package management, while `rosdep` is used specifically for managing ROS package dependencies. Together, they enable you to install and manage both the core ROS components and additional ROS packages required for your robotic application.
