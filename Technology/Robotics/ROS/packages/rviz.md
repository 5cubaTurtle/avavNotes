rviz is a 3D visualization tool that allows you to display and interact with sensor data, robot models, and other visualization elements. It provides a graphical interface for debugging, analyzing, and monitoring your robot's perception and state. With a topic as input, it visualizes that based on the message type being published, which allows us to see the environment from the perspective of the robot.

To use rviz, you can include it in your launch file or launch it separately using the `rviz` command. You can configure rviz to subscribe to specific topics and display data in the desired format.
