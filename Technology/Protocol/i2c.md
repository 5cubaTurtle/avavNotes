I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) is a bus interface standard that allows communication between multiple devices using a two-wire serial interface. It is commonly used in embedded systems, particularly for communication between microcontrollers and sensors, but also for other devices such as real-time clocks, EEPROMs, and LCD displays.

In the context of the Linux kernel, the i2c directory under kernel/drivers/media contains drivers for video capture devices that communicate over the I2C bus. These drivers allow the kernel to communicate with the devices and capture video data from them.
