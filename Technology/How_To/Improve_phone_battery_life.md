- Reset adaptive battery: `settings` > `Apps` > `All apps` > `Device Health Services` > `Storage & cache` > `Clear storage` and then `Clear cache`
- Set all apps to restricted battery usage, unless you need an app to run in the background. Google apps and services I left on default.
- Disable `mobile data always active` in the developer settings.
- `Wi-Fi scanning` off
- `Bluetooth scanning` off
- `Now Playing` off
- Performed a full drain from 100 to 0. I did this 1 time. I then charged it back to full without touching it while it charged.
