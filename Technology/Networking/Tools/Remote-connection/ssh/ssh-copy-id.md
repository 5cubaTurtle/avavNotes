#ssh #network 

Use locally available keys to authorize logins on a remote machine.
`ssh-copy-id` registers an ssh key (generated by [[ssh-keygen]]) to a remote machine, allowing future connections without prompt for password.

Save your public key(id_rsa.pub) into the server (remote machine). Into *~/.ssh/authorized_keys* file:   `ssh-copy-id <username>@<host>`,  you will be prompted for the password of the user `<username>`.
