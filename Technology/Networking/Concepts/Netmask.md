#network 

The subnet mask (or simply, _netmask_) is a local bit mask, or set of flags, which separate the portions of an IP address significant to the network from the bits significant to the _subnetwork_. For example, in a Class C network, the standard netmask is 255.255.255.0 which masks the first three bytes of the IP address and allows the last byte of the IP address to remain available for specifying hosts on the subnetwork.
