The broadcast address is an IP address that allows network data to be sent simultaneously to all hosts on a given subnetwork, rather than specifying a particular host. The standard general broadcast address for IP networks is 255.255.255.255, but this broadcast address cannot be used to send a broadcast message to every host on the Internet because routers block it. A more appropriate broadcast address is set to match a specific subnetwork. For example, on the private Class C IP network, 192.168.1.0, the broadcast address is 192.168.1.255. Broadcast messages are typically produced by network protocols such as the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) and the Routing Information Protocol (RIP).
