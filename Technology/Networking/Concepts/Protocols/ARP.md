Address Resolution protocol is a [communication protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_protocol "Communication protocol") used for discovering the [link layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_layer "Link layer") address, such as a [MAC address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address "MAC address"), associated with a given [internet layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_layer "Internet layer") address, typically an [IPv4 address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4_address "IPv4 address"). This mapping is a critical function in the [Internet protocol suite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite "Internet protocol suite").
The Address Resolution Protocol is a [request-response](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request-response "Request-response") protocol. Its messages are directly encapsulated by a link layer protocol. It is communicated within the boundaries of a single [[Subnet|subnetwork]] and is never [routed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Routed "Routed").
