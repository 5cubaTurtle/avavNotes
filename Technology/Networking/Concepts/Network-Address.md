#network 

The network address represents the bytes comprising the network portion of an IP address. For example, the host 12.128.1.2 in a Class A network would use 12.0.0.0 as the network address, where twelve (12) represents the first byte of the IP address, (the network part) and zeroes (0) in all of the remaining three bytes to represent the potential host values. A network host using the private IP address 192.168.1.100 would in turn use a network address of 192.168.1.0, which specifies the first three bytes of the Class C 192.168.1 network and a zero (0) for all the possible hosts on the network.
