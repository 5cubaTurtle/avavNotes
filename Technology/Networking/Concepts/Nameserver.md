Nameserver addresses represent the IP addresses of Domain Name Service (DNS) systems, which resolve network hostnames into IP addresses. There are three levels of nameserver addresses, which may be specified in order of precedence: The _primary_ nameserver, the _secondary_ nameserver, and the _tertiary_ nameserver. So that your system can resolve network hostnames into their corresponding IP addresses, you must specify valid nameserver addresses that you are authorized to use in your systemâ€™s TCP/IP configuration. In many cases, these addresses can and will be provided by your network service provider, but many free and publicly accessible nameservers are available for use, such as the Level3 (Verizon) servers with IP addresses from 4.2.2.1 to 4.2.2.6.
