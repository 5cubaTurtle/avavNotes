### Daemon thread
The line `self.video_thread.daemon = True` is used to set the thread as a daemon thread. [[Daemon]] threads have a specific behavior in Python:

### Daemon Threads vs Non-Daemon Threads

- **Daemon Threads**: These threads run in the background and do not prevent the program from exiting. When all non-daemon threads (i.e., the main thread and any non-daemon threads) have completed, the Python interpreter will automatically terminate any daemon threads still running.
    
- **Non-Daemon Threads**: These threads, on the other hand, keep the program running until they themselves complete. The interpreter will wait for these threads to finish before exiting.
    

### Purpose in Your Application

Setting `self.video_thread.daemon = True` ensures that the video receiving thread will not prevent your application from exiting. This is important for a few reasons:

1. **Graceful Shutdown**: If your main program or other non-daemon threads complete their execution and your daemon thread is still running, the interpreter will automatically stop the daemon thread and exit. This ensures that the application can close gracefully without having to explicitly stop the video thread.
    
2. **Background Tasks**: Daemon threads are useful for background tasks that should not block the program from exiting. In this case, receiving the video stream is a background task that doesn't need to block the application shutdown.
    
3. **Simplifies Code**: It simplifies your code because you don't need to add additional logic to check if the thread is running and then stop it when the application is closing.

```python
import threading
import time

def daemon_thread_function():
    while True:
        print("Daemon thread is running...")
        time.sleep(1)

def non_daemon_thread_function():
    for i in range(5):
        print("Non-daemon thread is running...")
        time.sleep(1)

daemon_thread = threading.Thread(target=daemon_thread_function)
daemon_thread.daemon = True

non_daemon_thread = threading.Thread(target=non_daemon_thread_function)

daemon_thread.start()
non_daemon_thread.start()

non_daemon_thread.join()  # Wait for the non-daemon thread to finish
print("Main program finished")
```
In this example, the daemon thread will be stopped automatically when the main program finishes executing, whereas the non-daemon thread will run to completion before the program exits.
