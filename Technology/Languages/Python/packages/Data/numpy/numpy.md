#numpy 
#### frombuffer()
The `numpy.frombuffer` function in NumPy is used to interpret a buffer as a one-dimensional array. It creates a new array object that points to the same buffer as the input, but with a different shape and data type.

The function takes two arguments:

-   `buffer`: A buffer-like object, such as a bytes object, bytearray, or memoryview, that contains the data to be interpreted as an array.
-   `dtype` (optional): The data type of the elements in the resulting array. If not specified, NumPy will try to infer the data type from the buffer object.

Here's an example usage of `numpy.frombuffer`:
```python
import numpy as np

# Create a buffer object
buf = bytearray(b'\x01\x02\x03\x04\x05\x06\x07\x08')

# Interpret the buffer as an array of 32-bit integers
arr = np.frombuffer(buf, dtype=np.int32)

print(arr)
# Output: [16909060  84281096]
```
We create a bytearray `buf` that contains eight bytes of data. We then use `numpy.frombuffer` to interpret `buf` as an array of 32-bit integers. The resulting `arr` array has two elements, since each 32-bit integer requires four bytes of storage.

Note that `numpy.frombuffer` does not copy the data in the buffer. Instead, it creates a new array object that points to the same memory as the buffer. Therefore, any changes made to the array will also affect the original buffer object.
