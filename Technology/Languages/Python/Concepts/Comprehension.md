`[x**2 for x in range(10)]`
produces:
[0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]

Here the `x**2` is an operation on each element of `range(10)`, a list of integers from 0 to 9. Notice that we have to name the variable accordingly to the operation (`x**2` this operations squares the `x` thus we have to call the elements of `range(10)` by the variable `x` in order to square them).
