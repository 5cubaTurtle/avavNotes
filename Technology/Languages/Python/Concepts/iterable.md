In programming, an iterable is an object that can be iterated over, meaning you can traverse its elements one by one. An iterable can be a sequence (such as a list, tuple, or string), a collection (such as a set, dictionary, or range), or any other object that implements the iterable protocol.

The iterable protocol requires the object to implement the `__iter__()` method, which returns an [[Iterator]] object. The iterator object is responsible for producing the individual elements of the iterable when iterated over.

Here's an example to demonstrate the concept of an iterable:

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  # A list is an iterable

# Iterating over the elements of the list
for item in my_list:
    print(item)
```

In this example, `my_list` is an iterable. The `for` loop iterates over the elements of the list, accessing each element (`item`) one by one.

Other examples of iterables include strings:

```python
my_string = "Hello"  # A string is an iterable

# Iterating over the characters of the string
for char in my_string:
    print(char)
```

In this case, the string `"Hello"` is an iterable, and the `for` loop iterates over its characters, printing each character (`char`) individually.

In summary, an iterable is an object that can be iterated over, allowing you to access its elements sequentially. It can be any object that implements the iterable protocol, typically by defining the `__iter__()` method.
