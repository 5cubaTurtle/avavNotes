### Installation
`pip3 install ipython`
### Save session
In IPython shell, you can save the current session using the `%save` magic command, and then resume it at a later time.
Syntax:
```python
%save my_session 1-10 15 20-25
```

- `my_session` is the filename or path where you want to save the session.
- `1-10 15 20-25` specifies the line numbers or ranges of lines that you want to save. You can customize this based on the specific lines you want to include in the saved session.

After executing the `%save` command, it will create a file with the specified name (e.g., `my_session.py`) containing the lines you selected from the session.

To resume the saved session later, you can run the saved file using the `%run` magic command. For example:

```python
%run my_session.py
```

This will execute the lines from the saved file, effectively resuming the session as it was saved.

Note that the `%save` and `%run` commands are specific to the IPython shell and may not work in other Python environments or IDEs.

It's worth mentioning that there are also alternative approaches for saving and resuming sessions in IPython, such as using IPython notebooks or saving the session history as a log file. These methods provide more comprehensive ways to save and reproduce the entire session, including input, output, and code execution history.
