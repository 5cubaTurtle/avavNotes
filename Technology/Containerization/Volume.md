A mechanism for persisting data generated by and used by [[container]]s. Volumes provide a way to store and share data between containers and between a [[container]] and its host machine.

1. **Data Persistence**: Volumes allow data to persist beyond the lifecycle of a container. This means that even if a container is stopped or deleted, the data stored in the volume remains intact.
2. **Shared Storage**: Volumes enable multiple containers to share the same data. This is useful for scenarios where multiple containers need access to the same files or databases.
3. **Separation of Concerns**: Volumes separate the concerns of data storage and application logic. This makes it easier to manage data independently from the application, and it allows for more flexibility in terms of data management and backup strategies.
4. **Types of Volumes**: There are different types of volumes in containerization, including host-mounted volumes, which are directories on the host machine that are mounted into containers; named volumes, which are managed by Docker and have a lifecycle independent of the containers using them; and Docker-managed volumes, which are volumes created and managed by Docker.
5. **Usage**: Volumes can be used for various purposes, such as storing application configuration files, storing persistent database files, sharing log files between containers, and more.
