A virtual machine is a software emulation of a physical computer that runs an operating system and applications. Unlike [[container]]s, which share the host operating system kernel and resources, each virtual machine includes a complete operating system stack, allowing multiple virtual machines to run on a single physical host independently. Virtual machines provide isolation and flexibility but tend to consume more resources and have slower startup times compared to containers.
