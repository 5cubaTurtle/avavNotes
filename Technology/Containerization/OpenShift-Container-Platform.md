A [[Kubernetes]]-based container orchestration platform developed by Red Hat. It builds on top of [[Kubernetes]] but provides additional features and capabilities to simplify the deployment, management, and scaling of containerized applications.

1. **Kubernetes Compatibility**:
   - OpenShift is built on Kubernetes, which means it is fully compatible with Kubernetes APIs and tooling. Users familiar with Kubernetes can leverage their knowledge and skills when working with OpenShift.

2. **Enhanced Developer Experience**:
   - OpenShift provides additional developer-centric features and tools to streamline the application development process. This includes built-in continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines, developer workflows, and integration with popular development tools like Git.

3. **Integrated Container Registry**:
   - OpenShift includes an integrated container registry, allowing users to store and manage container images securely within the platform. This simplifies the process of building, sharing, and deploying containerized applications.

4. **Built-in Security and Compliance**:
   - OpenShift incorporates security features such as role-based access control (RBAC), network policies, image scanning, and encryption to ensure the security and compliance of containerized workloads. It provides a more secure environment for running applications compared to vanilla Kubernetes deployments.

5. **Operator Framework**:
   - OpenShift introduces the concept of Operators, which are a method of packaging, deploying, and managing Kubernetes applications. Operators automate common operational tasks and enable the delivery of complex, stateful applications on Kubernetes. This simplifies the management of applications and infrastructure on the platform.

6. **Enterprise Support**:
   - OpenShift is backed by Red Hat and provides enterprise-grade support, including long-term stability, security patches, and certifications. This makes it suitable for mission-critical workloads in production environments.

It provides a comprehensive solution for building, deploying, and managing cloud-native applications at scale.
