**QEMU** (Quick Emulator[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QEMU#cite_note-3)) is a [free and open-source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source "Free and open-source") [emulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emulator "Emulator"). It emulates a computer's [processor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit "Central processing unit") through dynamic [binary translation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_translation "Binary translation") and provides a set of different hardware and device models for the machine, enabling it to run a variety of [guest operating systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guest_operating_system "Guest operating system"). It can interoperate with [Kernel-based Virtual Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel-based_Virtual_Machine "Kernel-based Virtual Machine") (KVM) to run virtual machines at near-native speed. QEMU can also do emulation for user-level processes, allowing applications compiled for one architecture to run on another.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QEMU#cite_note-hoxLZ-4)
