- Before beginning coding, make a design in a notebook. Consider the following:
	- Readability
	- Maintainability
	- Scalability
- Keep to small codebase changes. Also when adding a new feature:
	- If the feature is big, break it down into smaller logical parts.
	- Commit often and test each commit.
- Prioritize learning concepts over new languages or frameworks.
- Don't work on more than one thing at a time.
- Embrace and welcome criticism of your code.
