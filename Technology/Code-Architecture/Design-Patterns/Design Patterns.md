Design patterns are proven solutions to common software design problems that help developers write reusable, maintainable, and elegant code. They are antidotes to anti-patterns, providing well-structured solutions to recurring problems that often lead to messy or error-prone code.

Design patterns help you choose design alternatives that make a system reusable and avoid alternatives that compromise reusability. Design patterns can even improve the documentation and maintenance of existing systems by furnishing an explicit specification of class and object interactions and their underlying intent. Put simply, design patterns help a designer get a design "right" faster.
