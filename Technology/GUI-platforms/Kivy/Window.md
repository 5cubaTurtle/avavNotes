The `Window` object represents the application window where your Kivy app's content is displayed. It provides various properties and methods to interact with and control the application window.

Example:
```python
from kivy.core.window import Window

class MyApp(App):
    def build(self):
        Window.bind(on_key_down=self.on_key_down)
        return Label(text='Press any key')

    def on_key_down(self, window, key, *args):
        print(f'Key {key} pressed')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    MyApp().run()
```
Here, the line `Window.bind(on_key_down=self.on_keyboard_down)` is used to bind a handler function (`self.on_keyboard_down`) to the `on_key_down` event of the `Window`. This means that whenever a key is pressed while the Kivy app window is in focus, the `on_keyboard_down` method will be called.
