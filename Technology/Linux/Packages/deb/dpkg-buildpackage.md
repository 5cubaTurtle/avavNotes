build binary or source packages from sources

The following command, `dpkg-buildpackage -Isubs -Itests -Idb -Icov_report -Iobj* -k$(SIGNER) -us -uc`, is used to build a Debian package from source code. Here's an explanation of the different options:

-   `-Isubs` instructs dpkg-buildpackage to ignore the `subs` directory when building the package.
-   `-Iobj*` instructs dpkg-buildpackage to ignore any directories starting with `obj` when building the package.
-   `-k$(SIGNER)` specifies the key to use for signing the package. The `$(SIGNER)` variable is assumed to contain the name of the GPG key to use for signing the package.
-   `-us` instructs dpkg-buildpackage to not sign the source package.
-   `-uc` instructs dpkg-buildpackage to not sign the .changes file produced by the build.

In summary, this command is used to build a Debian package while ignoring certain directories, and signing the package using a specified GPG key. The resulting package will not be signed, but the .changes file produced by the build will also not be signed.

#### output file
The output ".deb" file name is typically generated based on the package's name, version, and architecture. Here's how the ".deb" file name is structured:
```
<package-name>_<package-version>_<architecture>.deb
```
- `<package-name>` is the name of the Debian package, which is usually defined in the "debian/control" file as the "Package" field.
- `<package-version>` is the version of the package, defined in the "debian/changelog" file.
- `<architecture>` is the architecture for which the package is built, such as "amd64" for 64-bit x86 systems or "i386" for 32-bit x86 systems.
For example, if you were building a package named "example-package" with version "1.0" for the "amd64" architecture, the resulting ".deb" file would be named:
```
example-package_1.0_amd64.deb
```

### rules
The "debian/rules" file is a critical component of the Debian packaging system. It plays a crucial role in building and packaging Debian packages. The main use of the "debian/rules" file is to provide instructions on how to build the software from its source code and how to package it into a Debian package format (e.g., a ".deb" package).

Here's what the "debian/rules" file typically contains and its primary functions:
1. **Build Rules**: The file contains a set of rules and commands that define how to compile and build the software from its source code. These rules can vary significantly depending on the software being packaged. For example, they may involve running "configure," "make," and "make install" commands, among others.
2. **Clean and Prepare**: It includes instructions on how to clean up any build artifacts from previous builds and prepare the source code for a fresh build.
3. **Installation**: Specifies how to install the built software into a temporary directory, where it will be staged before packaging. This allows the Debian packaging system to inspect the installed files, set permissions, and create the final package.
4. **Package Creation**: Defines how to create the Debian package from the staged files. This involves creating control files, specifying package metadata, and arranging files into the appropriate directories within the package.
5. **Binary and Source Packages**: "debian/rules" can also differentiate between building binary packages (those containing the compiled software) and source packages (containing the original source code and Debian-specific packaging files).
6. **Clean-up**: After successful packaging, the rules file may include instructions to clean up any temporary or intermediate files and directories generated during the packaging process.
7. **Customization**: Package maintainers can add custom logic or commands to the "debian/rules" file to handle software-specific build and packaging requirements.
Overall, the "debian/rules" file serves as a script that automates the process of building and packaging software into Debian packages. It ensures consistency and adherence to Debian packaging standards, making it easier for software to be distributed and managed on Debian-based systems. Different software projects may have different "debian/rules" files tailored to their specific build and packaging needs.

Example rules file from Bladeranger repository llc_arduino:
```rules
#!/usr/bin/make -f

# The debian package for llc_arduino artifacts for installation on pleco robots.

export DH_VERBOSE=1
export DESTDIR=$(shell pwd)/debian/br-pleco-microprocessor
export HEXDIR=$(DESTDIR)/usr/lib/br/microprocessor
export DESTBIN=$(DESTDIR)/usr/bin

%:
	dh $@

override_dh_update_autotools_config:
	pwd

override_dh_auto_configure:
	echo "nothing to configure"

override_dh_update_autotools_config:
	# pwd = root (llc_arduino)
	rm -rf $(HEXDIR)
	mkdir -p $(HEXDIR)
	mkdir -p $(DESTBIN)
	cp bin/br-microprocessor $(DESTBIN)
	tests/build_all.sh --model pleco2 --robot general --target $(HEXDIR) --target-format '{model}.hex'

override_dh_prep:
	echo "prep would remove the directory we already populated, override it"

override_dh_shlibdeps:
	echo "skip dh_shlibdeps"
```
1. `#!/usr/bin/make`: This part of the line specifies the interpreter or executable that should be used to run the "debian/rules" file. In this case, it specifies the `make` command, which is a build automation tool used in many software projects. "make" is responsible for reading and executing the build instructions defined in the "debian/rules" file.
2. `-f`: The `-f` option is used to specify a makefile. In this context, it tells the `make` command to read and interpret the "debian/rules" file as a makefile.

So, when you run the "debian/rules" file, the shebang line ensures that the `make` command is used to execute the instructions within the file as if it were a makefile. This is a common convention in Debian packaging, as it leverages the power and flexibility of the "make" tool to handle the build and packaging processes for software packages.
