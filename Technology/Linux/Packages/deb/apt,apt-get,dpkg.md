[[dpkg]], [[apt-get]], and [[apt]] are all package management tools used to install, remove, and manage software packages.

- "dpkg" is the Debian package management system. It is a low-level tool used to manage individual packages on an Ubuntu system. With dpkg, you can install, remove, and inspect packages.

- "apt-get" is a command-line tool used to manage packages on Ubuntu systems. It is built on top of dpkg and provides a more user-friendly interface for managing packages. With apt-get, you can install, remove, and update packages as well as search for packages in the Ubuntu repositories.

- "apt" is the newer package management tool used on Ubuntu systems, which has replaced "apt-get" in the newer versions of Ubuntu. Apt is also built on top of dpkg and provides a more user-friendly interface than "dpkg" while being faster than "apt-get". It also provides additional features such as support for automatic dependency resolution, which simplifies package installation and management.

Overall, both [[apt-get]] and [[apt]] are front-ends to [[dpkg]] and provide a more user-friendly interface for managing packages on Ubuntu systems.
