The `Requires=` and `After=` directives in a systemd unit file are related,
The `Requires=` directive is used to specify a dependency between two systemd units. If a unit has `Requires=` set to another unit, systemd will ensure that the dependent unit is started along with the primary unit, and that if the dependent unit fails, the primary unit will also fail. The `Requires=` directive is a hard requirement and the dependent unit is considered essential for the primary unit to function correctly.

On the other hand, the `After=` directive is used to specify the order in which two systemd units should be started. If a unit has `After=` set to another unit, systemd will start the dependent unit after the primary unit has been started. The `After=` directive is not a dependency in itself, but only affects the order of unit start-up.

`Requires=` sets a hard dependency between two units, while `After=` only sets the order of unit start-up.
If a unit `Requires=` another unit, the dependent unit must be started for the primary unit to start. If a unit `After=` another unit, the primary unit will start first, followed by the dependent unit.
If a unit `Requires=` another unit and the dependent unit fails, the primary unit will also fail. If a unit `After=` another unit, the primary unit will not fail if the dependent unit fails.

To ensure proper operation of a service, it may require other services to be started before or along with it, so both `Requires=` and `After=` directives can be used together to ensure proper startup and dependencies between systemd units.
