The `EnvironmentFile` directive in a systemd service unit file is used to specify one or more files from which systemd should read environment variable assignments for the service. It allows you to define multiple environment variables in a separate file, which can be sourced by the service.

The `EnvironmentFile` directive has the following syntax:

```
EnvironmentFile=/path/to/file
```

You can specify multiple `EnvironmentFile` directives in a service unit file to include multiple files:
```
[Service]
EnvironmentFile=/etc/environment_vars
EnvironmentFile=/etc/more_environment_vars
```
In the above example, systemd will read environment variable assignments from the files `/etc/environment_vars` and `/etc/more_environment_vars` and make them available to the service.

The environment variable files should contain variable assignments in the format `VAR=VALUE`, with one assignment per line. Comments starting with `#` are also allowed.

`/etc/environment_vars` could be:
```
VAR1=value1
VAR2=value2
```
The environment variables defined in the specified files will be set for the service when it is started.

Using `EnvironmentFile` allows you to manage environment variables separately from the service unit file, making it easier to modify or update environment variable values without modifying the service configuration directly.
`Environment` directive takes precedence over `EnvironmentFile`.
