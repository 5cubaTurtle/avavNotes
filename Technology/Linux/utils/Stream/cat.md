concatenate files and print on the standard output

concatenate 2 files into 1: `cat file1 file2 > resultFile`
concatenate some files into one:   `cat full_images_*.raw > full_images.raw`

write to a file: `cat > file.txt`, then write the text ending with a `^D` (Ctrl+D).
- `^D` is the *end of file character*.
