Dynamic Kernel Module Support

The `dkms` command in Linux is used to install and manage kernel modules, which are pieces of software that can be loaded into the Linux kernel at runtime. DKMS stands for "Dynamic Kernel Module Support."

The DKMS (Dynamic Kernel Module Support) command in Linux is used to manage and rebuild kernel modules that are installed on a system. DKMS is typically used to ensure that third-party kernel modules, such as those for device drivers, are kept up-to-date with changes made to the Linux kernel.

DKMS works by maintaining a repository of source code for each kernel module installed on the system. When a new kernel is installed, DKMS will use this repository to rebuild the modules, ensuring that they are compatible with the new kernel.

To use DKMS, you typically need to install the DKMS package for your Linux distribution, and then install any third-party kernel modules using the DKMS command. Once installed, DKMS will automatically manage the rebuilding of the modules whenever a new kernel is installed on the system.
