Send a signal to a process

Stop process by PID:`kill -9 <PID>`

examples:
`kill -9 -1` Kill all processes you can kill.
`kill -l 11` Translate number 11 into a signal name.
`kill -L` List the available signal choices in a nice table.

When a process receives the `SIGINT` or the `SIGTERM` signal, it should stop its current operation and perform any necessary cleanup before terminating.

`SIGTERM`: This signal is a general termination signal that can be caught and handled by a process.
`SIGINT`: This signal is typically generated by the user pressing *Ctrl+C* in the terminal. The SIGINT signal can also be caught and handled by a process, but it is intended to be used for interactive processes that can respond to user input.
