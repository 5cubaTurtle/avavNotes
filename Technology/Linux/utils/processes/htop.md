Provides an interactive and real-time display of system processes, CPU usage, memory usage, and other system-related information.
When you run the `htop` command, it launches a terminal-based graphical user interface (GUI) that presents an organized and dynamic view of the system's processes.

Here are some key features and functionality of `htop`:
1. Process listing: `htop` lists all running processes, displaying their process IDs (PIDs), CPU usage, memory usage, process names, and other relevant details.
2. Color-coded display: Processes in `htop` are color-coded to represent different aspects such as CPU usage, memory usage, and process states. This makes it easier to quickly identify resource-intensive processes.
3. Sorting and filtering: `htop` allows you to sort processes based on various criteria, such as CPU usage, memory usage, or process ID. You can also filter the displayed processes based on specific criteria.
4. Process manipulation: `htop` provides options to interact with processes. You can send signals to processes, terminate or kill processes, change process priority, and more.
5. System monitoring: In addition to process information, `htop` also displays system-related information such as CPU utilization, memory usage, swap usage, load averages, and uptime.
6. Interactive interface: `htop` offers an interactive interface where you can navigate and control the display using keyboard shortcuts. You can scroll through the process list, change settings, and perform actions on processes.
