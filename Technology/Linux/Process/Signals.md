List of signals
##### SIGTERM - terminate
General termination signal that can be caught and handled by a process.
##### SIGINT - interrupt
Stop the process.
Typically generated by the user pressing *Ctrl+C* in the terminal. The SIGINT can be caught and handled by a process.
Intended to be used for interactive processes that can respond to user input. 
##### SIGHUP - hangup
`SIGHUP` is sent to a process when its controlling terminal is no longer available.This can happen in various scenarios:
- **Terminal Hang-Up**:
    - Historically, `SIGHUP` was sent to processes associated with a terminal when the terminal closed, typically when a user logged out. This signaled processes to terminate gracefully.
- **Reloading Configuration**:
    - Many daemons and long-running processes use `SIGHUP` to trigger a reload of their configuration files. When a process receives a `SIGHUP`, it reinitializes itself based on the updated configuration without terminating.
- **Process Restart**:
    - In some cases, `SIGHUP` is used as a signal to instruct a process to restart itself. For example, in the context of process supervision systems like `systemd`, sending `SIGHUP` to a service may cause it to restart.
- **Controlling Daemon Behavior**:
    - Daemons and services may interpret `SIGHUP` differently based on their specific implementation. Some may ignore it entirely, while others may have custom behavior associated with it.
- **Session Leader Termination**:
    - If the terminal is a session leader, closing it may result in the `SIGHUP` signal being sent to the foreground process group in the session. This can lead to termination of multiple processes associated with the session.
