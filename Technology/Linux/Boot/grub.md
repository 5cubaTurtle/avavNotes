### Configure grub to appear at boot
info: `info -f grub -n 'Simple configuration'`

You'll need to edit your `/etc/default/grub` file:

- Comment the line: `# GRUB_TIMEOUT_STYLE=hidden`, this will cause to resort to the default setting: `GRUB_TIMEOUT_STYLE=menu`.
- Then change `GRUB_TIMEOUT=0` to `GRUB_TIMEOUT=5`, for instance, to give the grub menu a 5 second timeout before it automatically logs you in.
- Save changes and run `sudo update-grub` to apply changes.
