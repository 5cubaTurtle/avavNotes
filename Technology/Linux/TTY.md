Way back when computers were just starting to appear, there was an old-timey device called the teletypewriter (TTY). It allowed an operator to send a text message across a wire. In modern day usage, a TTY is a default terminal used to interface directly with your operating system. Linux borrows this terminology from UNIX.

Terminal applications like GNOME Terminal, Alacritty, and Guake are actually better known as terminal _emulators_, because they perform the job of a TTY on top of your [desktop environment](https://www.maketecheasier.com/difference-between-windows-managers-desktop-environments/). The TTY always sits behind any graphical interface. This distinction is exactly why you may be able to access your TTY using Ctrl + Alt + F3 even when you cannot open the terminal on your desktop.
